# 🚀 **Unveiling My Twitter Sentiment Analysis Project!** 🎉  

I'm thrilled to share my latest project where I explored the exciting world of **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and sentiment analysis using **machine learning** and **deep learning** techniques. Here's a glimpse of what I worked on:  

## 🔍 **Objective**:  
To analyze Twitter data and classify sentiments (Positive, Negative, Neutral) using advanced text preprocessing and modeling techniques.  

## 💻 **Key Highlights**:  
- Preprocessed tweets by tokenizing, lemmatizing, and removing stopwords.  
- Built powerful sentiment classifiers using **Bidirectional LSTM** and **GRU** and **RNN**layers.  
- Evaluated the models with **confusion matrices** and accuracy scores to ensure performance.   

##📊 **Dataset**:  
Data sourced from Kaggle's Twitter Sentiment Analysis competition, containing real-world tweets labeled with sentiment tags.  

##🛠️ **Technologies Used**:  
- Python  
- NLTK for text preprocessing  
- TensorFlow/Keras for modeling  
- Pandas and Matplotlib for data manipulation and visualization
